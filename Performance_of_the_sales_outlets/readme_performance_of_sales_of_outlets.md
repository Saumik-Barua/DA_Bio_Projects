``retail_dataset_us.csv`` contains:

- purchaseId
- item_ID
- purchasedate
- Quantity — the number of items in the purchase
- CustomerID
- ShopID
- loyalty_program — whether the customer is a member of the loyalty program

``product_codes_us.csv`` contains:

- productID
- price_per_one

Prepare a presentation with your findings. You can use any tool you want to make the presentation, but you must send it as a PDF. Put the link in the body of the main project.
